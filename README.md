[FDS final project repository]
The project was assigned in the course "Fundamentals of Data Science" (Master Degree in Data Science, Sapienza, Rome)

This project is based on a prediction with deep neural network models (Convolutional).

Problem: Our goal is to predict from _x-ray-scanner-images_ if there are or not _prohibited items_.

Data: from https://github.com/lutao2021/PIDray/tree/main we take the dataset that is not been uploaded here due to space limitations, but it is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zvMIc1bqteRN9Z36hHYpoTGoZArsh4mE


Literature review: "PIDray: A Large-scale X-ray Benchmark for Real-World Prohibited Item Detection" (L. Zhang)


Method: CNN, ...


Results:... to be continued
